# AnimeSuggester

My senior project from university. Utilizes a simple shell to allow users to search through a locally stored database of anime, create and edit a list of anime titles, and get suggestions based on how the user rates those anime on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.

List of shell commands:

"quit": Exits the program
"search": Lets you search for anime to add to your list
"remove": Lets you remove anime from your list
"options": Displays the controls
"view": Displays the current list of anime
"run": Runs the program to give suggestions based on the current anime in the list
"clear": Clears the user's anime list
